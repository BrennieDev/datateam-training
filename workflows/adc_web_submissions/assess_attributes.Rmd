## Assess Attributes

New submissions made through the web editor should have attributes created by the submitter. If there are no attributes, or if they are incomplete, please use the [email template](#need-attributes) to correspond with the submitter to ask for attributes.

Additonally, the web editor will not allow for the creation of custom units. Submitters should select `other/none` in the editor unit dropdown if they cannot find their desired unit. In the `eml` document, these will result in `dimensionless` units. Accordingly, new submissions should be checked for `dimensionless` units. This can be done with the following code.
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dim_units <- sapply(eml@dataset@otherEntity, function(x) {
      i <- datamgmt::which_in_eml(x@attributeList@attribute, "standardUnit", as("dimensionless", "standardUnit"))
      
      out <- sapply(i, function(j){
         list(entityName = x@entityName,
               attributeName = x@attributeList@attribute[[j]]@attributeName,
               attributeLabel = x@attributeList@attribute[[j]]@attributeLabel,
               attributeDefinition = x@attributeList@attribute[[j]]@attributeDefinition)
      })
      
  return(out)  
})
dim_units <- data.frame(t(do.call(cbind, dim_units)))
```

If dimensionless units are found, first check the `attributeDefinition`, `attributeLabel`, and `attributeName` to see if `dimensionless` seems to be an appropriate unit for the attribute. If there is any question about wether or not `dimensionless` seems appropriate, ask another member of the data team. If there is still any question about what the unit should be, reach out to the submitter and ask for clarification.
