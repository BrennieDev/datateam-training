## Explore EML

The first task when editing an `eml` file is navigating the `eml` file. An `eml` file is organized in a structure that contains many lists nested within other lists. 

The function `EML::eml_view()` (`install.packages("listviewer")` if it doesn't work) allows you to get a crude view of an `eml` file in the viewer. It can be useful for exploring the file.

To navigate this complex structure in R, use the `@` symbol. The `@` symbol allows you to go deeper into the `eml` structure. However, you have to tell R where you want to go in the structure when you use the `@` symbol. For example, if you want to go into the dataset of your `eml` you would use the command ```eml@dataset```. If you want to go to the creators of your data set you would use ```eml@dataset@creator```. Note here that `creators` are contained within `dataset`. If you aren't sure where you want to go, hit the tab button on your keyboard after typing `@` and a list of available locations in the structure will appear (e.g., `eml@<TAB>`):

Note if you hit tab, and the only option is `.Data`, this implies most likely that you are trying to go deeper within a list. For example ```eml@dataset@creator@<TAB>``` will return only `.Data`. This is because `creator` is a list object (i.e. you can have multiple creators). If you want to go deeper into the `eml` structure, you first must tell R which creator you are interested in. Do this by writing `[[i]]` first where `i` is index of the creator you are concerned with. 
For example, if you want to look at the first creator i = 1. Now ```eml@dataset@creator[[1]]@<TAB>``` will give you many more options. Note, `.Data` also sometimes means you have reached the end of a branch in the `eml` structure.

Another great resource for navigating the `eml` structure is [looking at the schema which defines the structure](https://github.com/NCEAS/eml) (also [here](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/index.html)). However, the schema is complicated and may take some time to get familiar with before you will be able to fully understand it.

For example, let's take a look at [eml-party](https://github.com/NCEAS/eml/blob/master/eml-party.png). To start off, notice that some elements are in solid boxes, whereas others are in dashed boxes.

<img src="../images/eml-surname.png" alt="solid" style="width: 150px;"/>  <img src="../images/eml-givenname.png" alt="dashed" style="width: 150px;"/>

A solid box indicates that the element is _required_ if the element above it (to the left in the schema) is used, whereas a dashed box indicates that the element is _optional_.

For a more detailed description of the `eml` schema, see the [reference section on exploring EML](https://nceas.github.io/datateam-training/reference/explore-eml.html).

### Access specific elements
The `eml_get` function is a powerful tool for exploring EML (more on that [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/EML/vignettes/parsing-EML.html)). It takes any chunk of `eml` and returns _all instances_ of the element you specify. _Note:_ you'll have to specify the element of interest exactly, according to the spelling/capitalization conventions used in EML. Here are some examples:

```{r}
library(EML)
eml <- EML::read_eml(system.file("example-eml.xml", package = "arcticdatautils"))
EML::eml_get(eml, "creator")
```

```{r}
EML::eml_get(eml, "boundingCoordinates")
```

```{r}
EML::eml_get(eml, "url")
```

You can also use the `which_in_eml` function from the `datamgmt` package to get indices within an `eml` list. Here are some examples:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Question: Which creators have a surName "Smith"?
n <- which_in_eml(eml@dataset@creator, "surName", "Smith")
# Answer: eml@dataset@creator[n]

# Question: Which dataTables have an entityName that begins with "2016"
n <- which_in_eml(eml@dataset@dataTable, "entityName", function(x) {grepl("^2016", x)})
# Answer: eml@dataset@dataTable[n]

# Question: Which attributes in dataTable[[1]] have a numberType "natural"?
n <- which_in_eml(eml@dataset@dataTable[[1]]@attributeList@attribute, "numberType", "natural")
# Answer: eml@dataset@dataTable[[1]]@attributeList@attribute[n]

#' # Question: Which dataTables have at least one attribute with a numberType "natural"?
n <- which_in_eml(eml@dataset@dataTable, "numberType", function(x) {"natural" %in% x})
# Answer: eml@dataset@dataTable[n]
```
