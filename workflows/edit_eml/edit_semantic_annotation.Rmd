## Semantic annotations

The training will cover an overview of what areas we usually will need to update. For more information on how to add semantic annotations to EML 2.2.0 can be found
 <a href = 'https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/semantic-annotation-primer.html'>here</a>. Currently metacatUI does not support the editing of semantic annotations on the website so all changes will have to be done in R.

### How annotations are used

This is a  <a href = 'https://arcticdata.io/catalog/view/doi%3A10.18739%2FA2KW57J9Q'>dataset</a> that have semantic annotations included.

On the website you can see annotations in each of the attributes.

You can click on any one of them to search for more datasets with that same annotation.

### Entity-level annotations

To add annotations to the `attributeList` you will need information about the `propertyURI` and `valueURI`
```{r eval=FALSE}
doc$dataset$dataTable[[i]]$attributeList$attribute[[i]]$annotation
```
```
$id
[1] "ODBcOyaTsg"

$propertyURI
$propertyURI$label
[1] "contains measurements of type"

$propertyURI$propertyURI
[1] "http://ecoinformatics.org/oboe/oboe.1.2/oboe-core.owl#containsMeasurementsOfType"


$valueURI
$valueURI$label
[1] "Distributed Biological Observatory region identifier"

$valueURI$valueURI
[1] "http://purl.dataone.org/odo/ECSO_00002617"
```

### Ontologies used

#### OBOE: The Extensible Observation Ontology

This <a href = 'https://github.com/NCEAS/oboe'>OBOE ontology</a> covers the following:

- **Observation**: an event in which one or more measurements are taken
Measurement: the measured value of a property for a specific object or phenomenon (e.g., 3.2)
- **Entity**: an object or phenomenon on which measurements are made (e.g., Quercus rubrum)
- **Characteristic**: the property being measured (e.g., VolumetricDensity)
Standard: units and controlled vocabularies for interpreting measured values (e.g., g/cm^3)
- **Protocol**: the procedures followed to obtain measurements (e.g., DensityProtocol2014)

All the classes can be found <a href = 'https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/OBOE/?p=classes'>on bioPortal</a>. You will need the ID (`propertyURI`) and the label from the relevant entry. If you are unsure, ask Jasmine or Jeanette about what appropriate annotations to use.
