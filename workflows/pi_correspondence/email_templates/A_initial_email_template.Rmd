> Hello _____,
> Thank you for your recent submission to the NSF Arctic Data Center!
> 
> From my preliminary examination of your submission I have noticed a few items that I would like to bring to your attention. We are here to help you publish your submission, but your continued assistance is needed to do so. See comments below:

> Best,

> [YOUR NAME]

#### Title

Provides the *what, where, and when* of the data

> We would like to add some more context to your data package title. A descriptive title that provides context about the what, where, and when of a data package is often far more useful in search results. Something like: ‘OUR SUGGESTION HERE, WHERE, WHEN’ might be an option.

Does not use acronyms

> We noticed that your title contains several acronyms or abbreviations. In order to increase discoverability of your title, please spell out all acronyms and abbreviations.

#### Abstract

Describes DATA in package (ideally > 100 words)

> Your abstract appears to be missing some information. We suggest that the abstract be sufficiently descriptive for a general scientific audience. It should provide an overview of the scientific context/ project/ hypotheses, how this data package fits into the larger project, a synopsis of the experimental or sampling design, and a summary of the data contents. If you prefer and it is appropriate, we could add language from the abstract in the NSF Award found here: [NSF AWARD URL].

#### Data

At least one data file

> We noticed that no data files were submitted. With the exception of sensitive social science data, we seek to  include all data products prior to publication. Do you intend to submit data files?

Open formats

*Example using xlsx. Tailor this reponse to the format in question.*

> We noticed that the submitted data files are in xlsx format. Please convert your files to a plain text/csv (or other open format); this helps ensure your data are usable in the long-term.


File contents and relationships among files are clear

> Could you provide a short description of the files submitted? Information about how each file was generated (what software, source files, etc.) allows other scientists to reproduce your work.

Missing value codes

> What do the missing values in your measurements represent? (instrument failure, site not found, etc.)

> We noticed that the data files contain blank cells. What do these represent? 

#### Funding

All NSF funded datasets need a funding number. Non-NSF funded datasets might not have funding numbers, depending on the funding organization.

> We noticed that your dataset does not appear to contain a funding number. Is this dataset funded by NSF? If so, please provide the funding number. If it is funded by a different organization, please provide the organization and funding number (if it exists).

#### Methods

Submissions should:
- provide instrument names
- specify how sampling locations were chosen
- provide citations for sampling methods that are not explained in detail

> Your methods section appears to be missing some information. Enough detail should be included so that a reasonable scientist can interpret the study and data for reuse without consulting you nor any other resources. Users should be able to understand how the data were collected, how to interpret the values, and potentially how to use the data in the case of specialized files. Please edit the data package to provide a more robust methods section.

> Comprehensive methods information ought to be included directly in the metadata record. Pointers or URLs to other sites are unstable and insufficient.

#### Attributes

> I noticed that your data package has incomplete attribute/variable information. Please add attribute/variable information to each of your data files. You can do so by navigating to your dataset [INSERT URL HERE], clicking the green "Edit" button, clicking the "Describe" button located to the right of each of your files at the top of the submission page, and in the window that pops up click over to the "Attributes" tab. Please see the guidance below for what attribute/variable information should contain.

> For data packages with tabular data (e.g. CSV files), submitted metadata should contain the following components for every attribute (variable). Also, please note that tabular data stored within structured formats such as NetCDF, or shapefiles files should also comply with these guidelines.

> - A name (often the column or row header in the file).
> - A complete definition.
> - Any missing value codes along with explanations for those codes.
> - For all numeric data, unit information is needed.
> - For all date-time data, a date-time format is needed (e.g. "DD-MM-YYYY").
> - For text data, full descriptions for all patterns or code/definition pairs are needed if the text is constrained to a list of patterns or codes.

> Could you describe ____? 
> Please define “XYZ”, including the unit of measure. 
> What are the units of measurement for the columns labeled “ABC” and “XYZ”?
