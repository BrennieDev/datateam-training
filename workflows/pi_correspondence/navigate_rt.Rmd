## Navigate RT

The [RT ticketing system](https://support.nceas.ucsb.edu/rt/) is how we
communicate with folks interacting with the Arctic Data Center.  
We use it for managing submissions, accessing issues, etc. It consists of
three separate interfaces:  
[Front Page](#front-page)  
[All Tickets](#all-tickets)  
[Ticket Page](#example-ticket)

### Front page 

![](../images/front_page_rt.png) 

This is what you see first   

1. Home - brings you to this homepage  
2. Tickets - to search for tickets (also see number 5)  
3. Tools - not needed  
4. New Ticket - create a new ticket  
5. Search - Type in the ticket number to quickly navigate to a ticket  
6. Queue - Lists all of the tickets currently in arcticdata and their status  
 + New = unopened tickets that require attention  
 + Open = tickets currently open, under investigation by team member  
 + Stalled = tickets awaiting response from PI/Submitter  
7. Tickets I Own - These are the current open tickets that are claimed by me  
8. Unowned Tickets - Newest tickets awaiting claim  
9. Ticket Status - Status and how long ago it was created  
10. Take - claim the ticket as yours  

### All tickets

This is the queue interface from number 6 of the Front page  
1. Ticket number and title  
2. Ticket status  
3. Owner - who has claimed the ticket  

### Example ticket
