## Spatial data

Shapefiles and their associated files can be kept in a single grouping using *.zip (or another similar format). To extract meatadata, simply run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(rgdal)
folder_path <- "/folder/path/dir1/dir2/"
folder_name <- "folder_name" #name of folder containing shapefiles and associated data
spatial_obj <- readOGR(dsn = paste0(folder_path, folder_name),
              layer = folder_name)
spatial_df <- spatial_obj@data #save data as a dataframe
spatial_obj@proj4string #get coordinate unit information
```
