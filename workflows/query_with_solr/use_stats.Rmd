## Use stats

With Faceting, we found we could make queries to find the unique values for a Solr field.
With Stats, we can have Solr calculate statistics on numerical values (such as `fileSize`).

- https://arcticdata.io/metacat/d1/mn/v2/query/solr/?q=formatType:DATA&stats=true&stats.field=size&rows=0

This query calculates a set of summary statistics for the `size` field on Data Objects that Solr has indexed.
In this case, Solr's `size` field indexes the `fileSize` field in the System Metadata for each Object in Metacat.
