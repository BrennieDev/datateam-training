## Use facets

Above we went through querying across Solr documents but we can also summarize what's in Solr with Faceting which lets us group Solr documents together and count them.
This is like `table` in R.
Faceting can do a query within a query, but more commonly I use it to summarize unique values in a field.
For example, we can find the unique format IDs on Data Objects:

- https://arcticdata.io/metacat/d1/mn/v2/query/solr/?q=*:*&fq=formatType:DATA&facet=true&facet.field=formatId&rows=0

To facet, we usually do a few things:

- Add the parameter `facet=true`
- Add the parameter `facet.field={FIELD}` with the field we want to facet (group) on
- Set `rows=0` because we don't care about the matched Solr documents
- Optionally specify `fq={expression}` which filters out Solr documents before faceting. In the above example, we have to do this to only count Data Objects. Without it, the facet result would include formatIDs for metadata and resource maps which we don't want.
