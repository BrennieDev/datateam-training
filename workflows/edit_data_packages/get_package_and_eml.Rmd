## Get package and EML

To update a package, you must load it into your R environment. After [setting your node](#set-dataone-nodes), use the following commands to load the package.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
rm_pid <- "your_resource_map_pid"

pkg <- arcticdatautils::get_package(mn,
                                    rm_pid,
                                    file_names = TRUE)
```

After loading the package, you can also load the eml file into R using the following command.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
eml <- EML::read_eml(rawToChar(dataone::getObject(mn, pkg$metadata)))
```

```{block, type = 'note'}
**Tip to always have the most recent resource map.**

When editing `resource_maps`, you always want to be working with the most recent update. To ensure you have the most recent `resource_map`, you can use the following commands.
```
``` {r, eval = FALSE, class.source = 'note'}
rm_pid_original <- "your_original_resource_map_pid"
all_rm_versions <- arcticdatautils::get_all_versions(mn, rm_pid_original)
rm_pid <- all_rm_versions[length(all_rm_versions)]
```
