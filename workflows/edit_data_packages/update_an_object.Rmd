## Update an object

To update an object (a data file), use `arcticdatautils::update_object`.

First make sure you have the package that contains the data you want to update, [loaded into R](#get-package-and-eml).

Then define the path to the updated object.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
data_path <- "path/to/data/file.csv"
```

Then update the object at the `Member Node`. When updating the object, it is best practice to update your `pkg` in R at the same time. In the following code, replace `i` with the index of the data pid you want to update.

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
pkg$data[i] <- update_object(mn,
                     pid <- pkg$data[i],
                     path <- data_path,
                     format_id = NULL,
                     new_pid = NULL,
                     sid = NULL)
```

Note that you will need to be explicit about your `format_id` here based on the file type. A list of format IDs can be found [here on the DataONE website](https://cn.dataone.org/cn/v2/formats).
