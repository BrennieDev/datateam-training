## Understand the EML schema

Another great resource for navigating the EML structure is looking at the [schema](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/schema/) which defines the structure. The schema diagrams on this page are interactive. Additional information on the schema and how different elements (or "slots") are defined can be found [here](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/index.html)). Further explanations of the symbology can be found [here](https://manual.altova.com/xmlspy/spyenterprise/index.html?xseditingviews_schv_cmview_objects.htm). The schema is complicated and may take some time to get familiar with before you will be able to fully understand it.

For example, let's take a look at [eml-party](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/images/eml-party.png). To start off, notice that some elements have bolded lines leading to them.

A bold line indicates that the element is _required_ if the element above it (to the left in the schema) is used, otherwise the element is _optional_.

Notice also that below the `givenName` element it says "0..infinity". This means that the element is unbounded &mdash; a single party can have many given names and there is no limit on how many you can add. However, this text does not appear for the `surName` element &mdash; a party can have only one surname.

You will also see icons linking the EML slots together, which indicate the ordering of subsequent slots. These can indicate either a "sequence" or a "choice". In our example from `eml-party`, a "choice" icon indicates that either an `individualName`, `organizationName`, or `positionName` is required, but you do not need all three. However, the "sequence" icon tells us that if you use an `individualName`, you must include the `surName` as a child element. If you include the optional child elements `salutation` and `givenName`, they must be written in the order presented in the schema.

The eml schema sections you may find particularly helpful include [eml-party](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/images/eml-party.png), [eml-attribute](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/images/eml-attribute.png), and [eml-physical](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/images/eml-physical.png).
